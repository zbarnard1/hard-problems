# What is this?
  This project, called "Hard Problems" (for now), is a collaborative research application.  It is intended for people who are searching for information on the same topic to benefit from each other's research and expertise.

# How ~~does~~ will it work?
  Since Hard Problems is still under development, it doesn't work quite yet.  Eventually, you will be able to enter a group of keywords and it will bring back results taken from multiple sources.  You will be able to mark the results that are relevant to keep them, while marking the irrelevant (or innacurate/biased/etc.) results to be excluded from your search.  If you wish, you can then synthesize the information from your results and save it to our database in association with a topic.  When someone is searching for information related to that topic, they'll be able to see the collection of works that the community has put together.

# Why are you doing this?
  This application will allow people working on difficult and complex problems to access the best information related to the topic and work together to find the solution, if one can be found.

  Feel free to contact me for more information as this project develops!
